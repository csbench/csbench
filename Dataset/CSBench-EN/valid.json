If the array is sorted first and then the linked list is created, the time complexity of creating the linked list is O(n), and the best time complexity for array sorting is O(nlog2n), resulting in a total time complexity of O(nlog2n). Therefore, option D is selected."

For example, binary trees and binary search trees can use the same logical representation and storage method of binary trees. The former is usually used to represent hierarchical relationships, while the latter is commonly used for sorting and searching. Although both have operations such as building a tree, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and searching for nodes, the definitions of these operations are different for binary trees and binary search trees. Taking node search as an example, the time complexity for a binary tree is O(n), while for a binary search tree, the time complexity is O(log2n)."

        "Question": "What are the differences between a heap and a binary search tree (BST)?",
        "Answer": "Taking the min-heap as an example, the characteristic of a heap is that the key of the parent node is always less than or equal to the key of its child node, with no specific order required between the keys of the two child nodes. In a binary search tree, the key of each parent node is greater than the keys of all nodes in the left subtree and less than the keys of all nodes in the right subtree, meaning there is an ordered relationship between the keys of the left and right children of each parent node. Thus, when performing an in-order traversal on both types of trees, the binary search tree will yield an ordered sequence, while the heap may not necessarily produce an ordered sequence."

        "Question": "How many branch nodes and leaf nodes does a full binary tree with n nodes have? What is the height of this full binary tree?",
        "Answer": "In a full binary tree, n1 = 0, from the properties of the binary tree, we can see that n2 = n0-1, n = n0 + n1 + n2 = 2*n0-1= 2n2+1, then n_0=(n+1)/2. The number of branch nodes n2=n-(n+1)/2=(n-1)/2. The number of nodes of a full binary tree with height h is n=1+2^1 +2^2 +...+2^(h-1) =2^h-1, i.e., height h=log2(n +1)."

Note: The larger the base, the less likely it is for the mantissa to shift right during calculations, resulting in less precision loss. Since the number of shifts required for alignment or mantissa overflow to the right and normalization to the left significantly decreases with a larger base, the computation speed can be increased. The larger the base, the greater the range of numbers that can be represented."

        "Question": "Instructions and data are both stored in memory; how does the CPU distinguish between them?",
        "Answer": "The completion of an instruction can typically be divided into the fetch phase and the execution phase. During the fetch phase, the instruction is retrieved by accessing the memory; during the execution phase, the operand is retrieved by accessing the memory. Therefore, although both instructions and data are stored in the memory in binary code form, the CPU can determine whether the binary code retrieved from the memory is an instruction or data based on the different stages of the instruction cycle."

        "D": "Distance Vector Protocol, Link State Protocol, Path Vector Protocol",
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "RIP is a distributed distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count as a metric for distance. The OSPF protocol employs a distributed link-state protocol, frequently exchanging link-state information with other routers to establish a topological map of the entire network, and then uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the optimal path to each destination network. Since BGP only seeks to find a route that can reach the destination network and is relatively good (without looping), rather than the best route, it uses a path vector routing protocol. In BGP, each autonomous system selects a BGP speaker, and these speakers exchange their path vectors (i.e., network reachability information) with each other to find better routes to each autonomous system."

        "Question": "Under the following circumstances, calculate the total time required to transmit a 100KB file, that is, the time from the start of the transmission until the last bit of the file reaches its destination. Assuming the round-trip time (RTT) is 100ms, a packet is 1KB (i.e., 1024B) of data, and the initial handshake process before starting to transmit the entire file data takes 2RTTs. 1) The bandwidth is 1.5Mb/s, and data packets can be sent continuously. 2) The bandwidth is 1.5Mb/s, but after sending each data packet, one must wait for an RTT (waiting for confirmation from the receiver) before sending the next data packet. 3) Assuming the bandwidth is an infinitely large value, meaning we consider the sending time to be 0, and after waiting for each RTT, up to 20 packets can be sent.",
        "Answer": "Hint: As mentioned before, if the problem does not specify to consider queuing delay, then processing delay should also not be considered. 1) From the hint, we know that the total delay = transmission delay + propagation delay + handshake delay, where the handshake delay is added by the problem. Two initial RTTs (handshake): 100x2=200ms, propagation time: RTT/2 = 100/2=50ms, 1KB=8bitx1024=8192bit, transmission time: 1000KB/(1.5Mb/s)=8192000bit/(1500000b/s)=5.46s, so the total time equals 0.2+5.46+0.05=5.71s. 2) Based on the answer to the previous sub-question, add another 999 RTTs, the total time is 5.71+999x0.1=105.61s. Note: The transmission time in 1) is the sum of the transmission times of all packets. 3) Since the transmission delay is 0, only the propagation delay needs to be calculated. Since each packet is 1KB, a file of 1000KB should be divided into 1000KB/1KB=1000 packets. Since 20 packets can be sent after each RTT, a total of 1000/20=50 times are needed, 50-1=49 RTTs, and the last packet only needs 0.5RTT to reach the destination (note that the RTT of this wait definitely includes the transmission delay of the previous transmission, so do not think that an additional transmission delay needs to be calculated), the total time is 2xRTT (handshake time) + 49RTT + 0.5RTT = 51.5RTT = 0.1x51.5 = 5.15s."

        "Question": "Ethernet uses the CSMA/CD protocol to access the shared communication channel in a contention-based manner. How does it compare to traditional Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) in terms of advantages and disadvantages?",
        "Answer": "CSMA/CD is a dynamic medium access control method that allows for random access to a shared channel, while TDM is a static channel division method. Therefore, in terms of channel utilization, CSMA/CD allows users to share the channel, which is more flexible and results in higher channel utilization. TDM is different; it allocates channels to users in fixed time slots, and if a user has no data to transmit, the channel is wasted during that user's time slot. Because CSMA/CD involves channel sharing, collisions can occur when multiple users need to use the channel simultaneously, thus reducing channel utilization; whereas in TDM, users do not conflict with others during their allocated time slots. For local area networks, the users connected to the channel are usually in close proximity, so the channel bandwidth is typically large. When using TDM, there are more instances where users do not send data during their time slots, which is not conducive to the full utilization of the channel. For computer communications, bursty data transmission is less suited to the TDM method."

        "Question": "On a certain satellite channel, the sender transmits a frame of 512B from one direction, and the data transmission rate of the sender is 64kb/s, while the receiver returns a very short acknowledgment frame at the other end. Assuming the one-way propagation delay of the satellite channel is 270ms, what are the channel throughputs for send window sizes of 1, 7, 17, and 117, respectively?",
        "Answer": " The length of a data frame is 512B, which is 512x8bit=4.096kbit. The transmission delay of a data frame is 4.096/64=0.064s. Therefore, a transmission cycle time is 0.064+2x0.27=0.604s. Hence, when the window size is 1, the channel's throughput is 1x4.096/0.604=6.8kb/s; when the window size is 7, the channel's throughput is 7x4.096/0.604=47.5kb/s. Since a transmission cycle is 0.604s and the transmission delay for a frame is 0.064s, when the transmission window size is greater than 0.604/0.064, which is greater than or equal to 10, the transmission window can ensure continuous sending. Therefore, when the transmission window size is 17 and 117, the channel's throughput reaches the full rate, equal to the data transmission rate of the sending end, which is 64kb/s."

        "Answer": "Assuming the length of the bus cable is L, then (125x8)/(100*10^6)=2L/(2*10^8), which yields L=1000m."

        "Question": "Given the destination address is 201.230.34.56 and the subnet mask is 255.255.240.0, determine the subnet address.",
        "Answer": "By converting the destination address and the subnet mask to binary and performing a bitwise AND operation, the subnet address can be obtained. However, in the destination address, the part corresponding to 255 in the subnet mask remains unchanged in the subnet address, the part corresponding to 0 in the subnet mask is 0 in the subnet address, and the other parts are obtained by a bitwise \"AND\" operation (or can be directly truncated). In this question, the first two parts of the subnet mask are 255.255, so the first two parts of the subnet address are 201.230; the last part of the subnet mask is 0, so the last part of the subnet address is 0; the third part of the subnet address is 240, which converts to 240=(11110000)2, and 34=(00100010)2, the bitwise \"AND\" results in (00100000)2=32. Therefore, the subnet address is 201.230.32.0."

        "Question": "Host A sends 3 consecutive TCP segments to Host B based on TCP. The sequence number of the first segment is 90, the sequence number of the second segment is 120, and the sequence number of the third segment is 150. 1) How much data is there in the first and second segments? 2) Assuming the second segment is lost and the other two segments reach Host B, what should be the acknowledgment number in the acknowledgment segment sent from Host B to Host A?",
        "Answer": "1) Note that each byte of data in the TCP stream has a sequence number, and the sequence number of a TCP segment is the number of the first byte of its data part. Therefore, the data in the first segment is 120-90=30B, and the data in the second segment is 150-120=30B.\n2) Since TCP uses a cumulative acknowledgment strategy, when the second segment is lost, the third segment becomes an out-of-order segment. B expects to receive the next segment with sequence number 120, so the acknowledgment number is 120."

        "Question": "DNS uses UDP instead of TCP; if a DNS packet is lost and there is no automatic recovery, would this cause a problem? If so, how should it be resolved?",
        "Answer": "DNS uses the transport layer's UDP instead of TCP because it does not require the automatic retransmission feature that TCP performs when a transmission error occurs. In fact, for access to DNS servers, multiple DNS requests return the same result, meaning that performing the operation multiple times has the same effect as doing it once. Therefore, DNS operations can be executed repeatedly. When a process makes a DNS request, it starts a timer. If the timer expires without receiving a reply, then it simply makes the request again, which is harmless."

        "Explanation": "Inter-process (thread) communication is one of the most frequently used functions of a microkernel, and thus almost all microkernel OSes incorporate it into the microkernel. Low-level I/O, which is closely related to hardware, should also be placed within the microkernel. Low-level process management and scheduling, which are part of the mechanism of scheduling functions, should be included in the microkernel. A microkernel OS places a small part that is closely related to hardware within the microkernel. The main function of the microkernel at this point is to capture interrupts and traps that occur and to handle interrupt responses. After identifying the interrupt or trap event, it then sends it to the relevant server for processing. Therefore, interrupt and trap handling should also be included in the microkernel. File system services, on the other hand, are implemented in file servers outside the microkernel, so only V should not be placed within the microkernel."

In this state, as long as other processes do not seek to enter the critical section of the running process, they should be allowed to run, that is, to be allocated the CPU. The critical section locked by the process is not accessible to other processes.

        "Explanation": "Grouping all the sectors of each track into a cluster means that the storage space of a track can be organized into a data block group, which is conducive to improving storage speed. When reading and writing to a disk, the read/write head first locates the track, a process called seeking, and then it can read from or write to the track. After reading or writing a complete track, the head will continue to seek the next track to complete the remaining work. Therefore, in the case of random seeking, the time to read and write a track includes both the seek time and the read/write time, which is T+r seconds. Since the total data volume is b bytes, the number of tracks it occupies is b/N, so the total average read/write time is (r+T)b/N seconds."

        "Question": "Why must inter-process communication rely on the kernel functions of the operating system? Briefly describe the main methods of process communication.",
        "Answer": "In operating systems, a process is the basic unit for competition and allocation of computer system resources. Each process has its own independent address space. To ensure that multiple processes can share physical memory without interfering with each other, the operating system uses hardware address mechanisms to strictly protect the address space of processes, restricting each process to access only its own address space. The specific answers are as follows. Each process has its own independent address space. Under the address protection mechanisms of the operating system and hardware, a process cannot access the address space of other processes, so it must rely on the system call functions of the operating system to achieve inter-process communication. The main methods of inter-process communication include: 1) Shared memory area. A shared memory area is created through a system call. Multiple processes can (through system calls) connect to the same shared memory area and exchange data between processes by accessing the shared memory area. When using shared memory areas, semaphores are needed to solve synchronization and mutual exclusion problems. 2) Message passing. Communication between processes is achieved through system calls for sending/receiving messages. When a process sends a message, the system copies the message from the user buffer to the kernel's message buffer, and then enqueues the message buffer into the message queue. The message sent by the process remains in the message queue until it is received by another process. When a process receives a message, the system dequeues the message buffer from the message queue, copies the message from the kernel's message buffer to the user buffer, and then releases the message buffer. 3) Pipe system. A pipe is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) stream of information, allowing multiple processes to write data to the pipe and multiple processes to read data from the pipe. During the read/write process, the operating system ensures that the order of data writing and reading is consistent. Processes communicate with each other by reading/writing to pipe files or pipe devices. 4) Shared files. Communication between processes is achieved through the file sharing functionality provided by the operating system. Here, semaphores are also needed to solve synchronization and mutual exclusion issues in file sharing operations."

        "Question": "In implementing a file system, to speed up the retrieval of file directories, the \"FCB decomposition method\" can be utilized. Assume that the directory file is stored on the disk, with each disk block being 512B. An FCB occupies 64B, of which the filename takes up 8B. The FCB is usually divided into two parts: the first part is 10B (including the filename and the internal file number), and the second part is 56B (including the internal file number and other descriptive information of the file). Suppose a directory file has a total of 254 FCBs. Please provide the average number of disk accesses required to find a specific FCB in the directory file before and after applying the decomposition method, assuming equal probability of accessing each file.",
        "Answer": "The directory is stored on the disk, and accessing the directory requires disk access, which is very slow. The principle of using the \"FCB decomposition method\" to speed up directory search is: to decompose a part of the FCB and store it in another data structure, while only retaining the basic information of the file and a pointer to that data structure in the directory. This effectively reduces the size of the directory, decreases the number of disk blocks occupied by the directory, and also reduces the number of times the disk is read when searching the directory, thereby speeding up the directory search. Because originally the entire FCB was in the directory, and the FCB decomposition method places part of the FCB content outside the directory, an additional disk read is required after searching the directory to gather all the contents of the FCB. Before the decomposition method, the number of disk blocks for the directory was 64x254/512=31.75, which is 32 blocks. Each of the first 31 blocks contained 512/64=8 entries, and the last block contained 254-31x8=6 entries. Therefore, the average number of disk accesses to find a certain FCB in that directory file was [8*(1+2+3+...+31)+6x32]/254 =16.38 times. After the decomposition method, the number of disk blocks for the directory was 10x254/512=4.96, which is 5 blocks. Each of the first 4 blocks contained 512/10=51 entries, and the last block contained 254-4x51=50 entries. The number of disk accesses required for the directory entries in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th blocks were 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 times, respectively. Therefore, the average number of disk accesses to find a certain FCB in that directory file was [51x(2+3+4+5)+50x6]/254=3.99 times."

        "Question": "In implementing a file system, to speed up the retrieval of file directories, the \"FCB splitting method\" can be utilized. Assume that the directory file is stored on the disk, with each disk block being 512B. The FCB occupies 64B, of which the file name takes up 8B. The FCB is typically split into two parts: the first part is 10B (including the file name and the internal file number), and the second part is 56B (including the internal file number and other descriptive information about the file). Generally, if the directory file occupies n disk blocks before splitting and uses m disk blocks to store the file name and internal file number after splitting, please provide the condition under which the number of disk accesses is reduced (assuming that both m and n disk blocks are exactly filled).",
        "Answer": "The directory is stored on the disk, and accessing the directory requires disk access, which is very slow. The principle of using the \"FCB decomposition method\" to speed up directory search is: part of the FCB is decomposed and stored in another data structure, while only the basic information of the file and a pointer to that data structure are left in the directory. This effectively reduces the size of the directory, decreases the number of disk blocks occupied by the directory, and also reduces the number of times the disk is read when searching the directory, thereby speeding up the directory search. Because originally the entire FCB was in the directory, and the FCB decomposition method places part of the FCB outside the directory, so after searching the directory, it is still necessary to read the disk once more to gather all the contents of the FCB. Before the decomposition method, the average number of disk accesses = (1+2+3+...+n)/n = (n+1)/2 times. After the decomposition method, the average number of disk accesses = [2+3+4+...+(m+1)]/m = (m+3)/2 times. In order to reduce the number of disk accesses, it is clear that (m+3)/2 < (n+1)/2, i.e., m < n-2."
